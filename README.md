Adoption is a complicated process that only a few people get the privilege to go through. While adopting from Korea I created a sequence diagram to describe the process to friends and family as well as parents interested in adopting.

The adoption process is different for each country, and this is merely meant to act as a guide and not as a difinitive record of the process.

[adoption.sdx](adoption.sdx) is an [SDEdit](http://sdedit.sourceforge.net/) file. It can be edited with a text editor or with SDEdit and rendered with SDEdit.
